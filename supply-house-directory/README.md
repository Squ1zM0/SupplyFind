Colorado HVAC Supply Houses (seed data)

This folder is intended to mirror the TechDirect-style data repo approach:
- hierarchical index.json files at each level
- branches stored as individual JSON files with lat/lon for distance sorting

Current coverage:
- Denver Metro: Johnstone Supply (Denver West), Ferguson (Denver 0383), United Refrigeration (Denver 01029)
- Colorado Springs: Johnstone Supply (Colorado Springs)

Notes:
- Some brand/parts metadata is intentionally left empty until you confirm the exact schema you want for "brands they rep" vs "manufacturers they have parts for".
- Geo accuracy notes are included per branch.
